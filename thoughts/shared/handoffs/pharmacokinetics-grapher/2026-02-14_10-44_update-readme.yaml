goal: "Update README with comprehensive documentation covering project status, installation, usage, and developer workflow"

now: "Implement Task 9 (PrescriptionList component) with list display, CRUD operations, and compare mode"

test: "npm run test:unit && npm run type-check && npm run lint"

done_this_session:
  - task: Write comprehensive README documentation
    files: [README.md]
  - task: Create git commit for README
    files: [README.md]

blockers: []

questions: []

decisions:
  - "README structure": Organized by audience (users, developers, contributors) with clear sections for setup, usage, testing, and troubleshooting
  - "Status documentation": Listed completed tasks 1-7, current work (Task 8), and upcoming features with emoji indicators
  - "Emphasis on educational disclaimer": Placed prominently to ensure users understand this is for visualization only, not medical dosing

findings:
  - "README was empty": Project had no initial documentation; comprehensive guide now covers all key information
  - "Project structure is clear": Core calculations separated from components, making architecture easy to explain
  - "Quality checks are comprehensive": Testing, linting, and type-checking all integrated into development workflow

worked:
  - "Structured documentation": Clear hierarchy with overview → setup → usage → architecture → development flow
  - "Command examples": Provided exact commands for common tasks (dev, build, test, lint)
  - "Project structure visualization": ASCII diagram shows file organization clearly
  - "Troubleshooting section": Addresses common issues developers face (port conflicts, Node version, dependencies)

failed: []

next:
  - Implement Task 9 (PrescriptionList component) with display of saved prescriptions
  - Add edit/delete/duplicate functionality for prescriptions
  - Implement comparison mode to overlay multiple drugs on same graph
  - Ensure all component tests pass before final integration

    message: "Add comprehensive README with current status and developer setup guide"
    timestamp: "2026-02-14 10:43"

context:
  - "Previous session (Task 7) completed GraphViewer component with 22 unit tests"
  - "Task 8 (App.vue integration) was already completed in previous commit"
  - "Project follows TDD workflow with comprehensive testing and quality checks"
  - "Core pharmacokinetics calculations use one-compartment first-order absorption model"
  - "All components validated with TypeScript strict mode, ESLint, and Vitest"
